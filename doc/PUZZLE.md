# Puzzles #

The player has to solve puzzles (in the p'n'c sense of the word) to ensure the battery tower is charged sufficiently. The puzzles (in the more literal sense of the word) are placed in fuseboxes around town.

<s>A couple of jokers are given to the player to skip harder puzzles if they want to.</s> There is a walkthrough available.

## Rapid clicker puzzle ##

A button is shown with various text prompts ("Fix", "Hit with a wrench", "Restore", "Fixify", ...) underneath a progress bar. The button needs to be clicked rapidly until the progress bar fills up.

## Maze puzzles ##

A set of windows is shown to the player. They need to be arranged in a specific arrangement by dragging, possibly resized.

A window with a large scrollable content is shown. The content has signs / clues which tell the player which direction to scroll next. There are buttons in the content, most of which are fake.
