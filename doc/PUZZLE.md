# Puzzles #

The player has to solve puzzles (in the p'n'c sense of the word) to ensure the battery tower is charged sufficiently. The puzzles (in the more literal sense of the word) are placed in fuseboxes around town.

A couple of jokers are given to the player to skip harder puzzles if they want to.

## Block puzzles ##

(various sizes)

A grid of blocks is shown, rows and columns can be slided around cyclically. Once the grid is solved, it shows:

 - 3x2 A button "Fix fusebox"
 - 2x3 A radio button set ("Fusebox: / x broken / - fixed")
 - 4x3 A slider ("Fusebox functionality: / 0% |------- 100%")

## Rapid clicker puzzle ##

A button is shown with various text prompts ("Fix", "Hit with a wrench", "Restore", "Fixify", ...) underneath a progress bar. The button needs to be clicked rapidly until the progress bar fills up.

## Maze puzzles ##

(various sizes)

A window with icons is shown. The icons represent the player and exits in the room. Drag 'n drop the player onto a door to go there. Moving icons, windows, monsters, mimics, etc.

## Slider puzzles ##

(various sizes)

A "lockpicking" puzzle. The player cannot directly control a set of sliders (the cursor turns into a cross), has to use a lockpick. Later instances might conceal the sliders, mirror them, require sound, etc.

## Assembly puzzles ##

(various sizes)

A set of windows is shown to the player. They need to be arranged in a specific arrangement by dragging, possibly resized.

## Sign puzzle ##

A window with a large scrollable content is shown. The content has signs / clues which tell the player which direction to scroll next. There are buttons in the content, most of which are fake.
